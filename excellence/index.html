      <p>
        As an Emergency Automation Support Engineer, Justin has supported operations at over <strong>100 Amazon Fulfillment Centers</strong> across the United States. During each high-impact event, he quickly stabilized production, coordinated with the right stakeholders, led detailed root-cause analyses, and ensured that lessons learned were clearly communicated to improve site operations and maintenance teams.

      <h2>Performance Improvement at Amazon Fulfillment Center</h2>
      <p>
        At one Amazon Fulfillment Center, a detailed performance review revealed significant reductions in system jams and defect rates while overall throughput increased. By Week 17, total jams had dropped to <strong>10,960</strong> — a <strong>36.5%</strong> decrease compared to Week 8. DPMO improved to <strong>1,870</strong> in Week 17, representing a <strong>43.1%</strong> reduction from Week 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this improvement especially notable is that these results occurred during periods of higher operational demand. For example, Week 14 saw a <strong>26.8%</strong> increase in building volume compared to Week 8, yet jams were <strong>15.3%</strong> lower. Comparing the peak jamming week (Week 8) to the latest data (Week 17), volume rose by <strong>11.7%</strong> while jams declined by <strong>36.5%</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These results demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous process optimization and collaboration between engineering, maintenance, and operations teams — reinforcing the value of rapid analysis, targeted adjustments, and strong communication across all levels.
